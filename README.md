# Phoenix2Switch

Phoenix2Switch is a free, open source app for Enfocus Switch available on the Enfocus Appstore:
https://www.enfocus.com/en/appstore/product/tilia-phoenix-connect

This app provides seamless connectivity between Enfocus Switch and the award winning tilia Phoenix with over 150 dynamic properties controlling virtually all facets of bound, folded, tiled, nested, and die-based imposition, eliminating the need to build pre-defined templates.  

A total of 13 export formats are supported to drive your press and finishing devices:

- Imposed PDF and JDF
- Die/cutting data as CFF2, DXF, PDF, and ZCC
- Detailed text-based reports in XML and JSON
- PDF-based reports
- Vector separation export for varnish and foiling
- PDF-based cover sheets
- Tiling reports
- Phoenix project files

Phoenix and Phoenix2Switch are developed by [Esko](https://esko.com) and [Enfocus](https://enfocus.com) respectively.

## Prerequisites

To run this app, you will need:
1. A licensed copy of Phoenix 7.0 or newer with the Automate module
2. A licensed copy of Enfocus Switch 2017 update 1 or newer

In order to make modifications to this script and use it with your Switch you will need to obtain the Switch Scripting Module from Enfocus. The module will also enable the SwitchScripter application, used to create, modify and debug scripts.

## Running the app

You can run the app directly in your Switch flows by using the Script element and selecting the tilia-phoenix-connect.sscript file from this repository.  Phoenix also needs to be running with "Switch Connector" automation endpoint started.

For more information on how to run Phoenix in automated environments including Switch please visit https://docs.esko.com/docs/en-us/phoenix/24.03/userguide/home.html#about.html

## Open source

This application and all code herein is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license.  You are free to customize this app as a script and use your modifications for commercial purposes with or without publishing your changes.

Tilia Labs is the sole maintainer of this repository, but we encourage suggestions and pull requests to help make this app better than ever for our global graphic arts community!

## Coding guidelines

Any coding contributions must follow these rules in order to be accepted:
1. Any changes to source need to be copied into the source.js file on each commit to track code changes in addition to the sscript file.
1. Any changes to properties require that the props.xml file be updated with the latest properties extracted from the sscript file.
1. We ask that all development preserve the existing coding style in source.js.
1. Any non-obvious code changes require clear comments.

## Phoenix

Built from the ground up to cut costs, Phoenix is a sophisticated true-AI planning and imposition application that has been boosting efficiencies for print service providers across all segments, from packaging, labels, commercial, corrugated, and wide format printing.

**Precise, Dynamic Imposition**

Phoenix Imposition AI takes an entirely different approach to common imposition solutions. Rather than template-driven, it operates according to machine and production requirements to generate print-ready layouts on-the-fly. It factors in parameters, such as job specifications, print devices, finishing requirements, and delivery considerations, to search across potentially millions of possibilities for the optimal layout. When a final option has been selected, tilia Phoenix generates print-ready layouts and JDF or die instructions, and reports, for all devices in the production chain.

**Tight Integration**

Uniting planning and prepress functions, Phoenix can be integrated into your chosen workflow or MIS system to enable fast accurate estimates, shrink prepress time, automate error-prone tasks, maximize media usage, and reduce postpress complexity.
